This readme is an introduction into my Poker project.

Aim: Train a poker bot to beat (human) players!
Inspiration: Pluribus!
Structure: Throughout the project I was considering a 6 player Fixed-Limit Texas Hold'em version of the game.

First step: The first step consisted in building  the structure of the poker game:

1) Consists of classes Game, Player, Card and Evaluator
2) At the beginning of the game all the (6) players have to be created.
3) Next: Deck is created
4) Next: cards are distributed
5) First betting round


) Fix the reward system
